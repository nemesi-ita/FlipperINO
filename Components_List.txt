Components:
- Arduino UNO Rev 3
- Buttons X6
- RGB LEDS
- Resistor list in the Building_Circuit.txt file
- Shift Register (IC used for Arduino port expansion): 74HC595


Connection modules:
- Bluetooth: HC-05 or HC-06 (HC-05 is used in this configuration and I recommend its use. It supports Master and Slave modes and has additional pins)

- WiFi: ESP32 has a 240 MHz dual-core processor, supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi, and offers more flash memory, RAM and ROM capacity than the ESP8266. 
	In addition, the ESP32 also has greater power management capability and supports several interfaces, including SPI, I2C, UART, ADC, DAC and PWM, and has the ability to operate in monitor mode

- USB 3.0: Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger

- IR receiver: TSOP4838. Supported frequencies from 30kHz to 56kHz.

- IR transmitter: VS1838B. Supports a frequency range of 20kHz to 60kHz, covering most frequencies used by common IR devices.

- ETH Shield: Arduino MKR ETH Shield. Used for Ethernet connection (OPTIONAL. See Building_Circuit.txt file for its configuration (Default --> Disabled))

- Portable battery: 3.7 V or higher, 18650 lithium/polymer battery or Adafruit's PowerBoost series LiPo batteries.
